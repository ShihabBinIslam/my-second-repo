  <h1>Inspiring State</h1> 
  <p>Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn’t ended. You fight like a younger man, <strong> nothing held back. It’s admirable, but mistaken.</strong> When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn’t considered an honor, it was a public service.</p>
